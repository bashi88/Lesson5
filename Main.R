# Exercise 5

# Selects the “industrial” (type == "industrial") railways
# Buffers the “industrial” railways with a buffer of 1000m (hint: gBuffer with byid=TRUE)
# Find the place (i.e. a city) that intersects with this buffer.
# Create a plot that shows the buffer, the points, and the name of the city
# write down the name of the city and the population of that city as one comment at the end of the script.
# Bonus (optional!): if you can also download and unzip this within the script.
